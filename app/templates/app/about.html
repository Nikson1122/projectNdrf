        <p class="intro-text">
            Nepal is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world due to its fragile geology, rugged
            topography, unplanned urbanization, and the escalating impacts of climate change. The country
            faces recurrent hazards such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, fires, droughts, epidemics, and
            climate-induced extreme events. These disasters have continuously resulted in loss of lives, damage
            to property and livelihoods, and long-term disruption to socio-economic development.
            <br/>
            Despite progress in disaster risk reduction and management, challenges remain in preparedness,
            coordination, rapid response, sustainable recovery, and strengthening resilience at community and
            institutional levels. There is a pressing need for an institution dedicated to building disaster
            preparedness, prevention, mitigation, response, recovery, and long-term resilience.
            <br/>
            In this context, the Nepal Disaster Resilience Foundation (NDRF) is envisioned as a non-profit, nonpolitical organization committed to strengthening disaster risk management and resilience across
            Nepal through capacity building, knowledge sharing, advocacy, coordination, and community
            empowerment.
